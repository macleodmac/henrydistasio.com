# Guardiola: I want Bayern

Manchester City Manager Pep Guardiola has expressed his delight to have at least three English teams in the Champions League quarters.

City joined fellow English sides Tottenham and Manchester United after thrashing Schalke 10-2 on aggregate.

“It is nice for English football,” said Guardiola.

"In the last decade, Spanish teams controlled everything. It is good for us. For English football, it's incredible."

Spanish sides have dominated the Champions League for the last five years, but their reign is looking very likely to come to an end.

City secured their place in the last eight after cruising to victory on Tuesday against German outfit Schalke.

Following their 3-2 victory in Germany last month, City showed no mercy as they put the Bundesliga side to the sword.

The first thirty-five minutes saw some action but not much finishing prowess as Schalke continued to fend off City pressure.

That all changed when a Sergio Aguero penalty broke the deadlock. The argentine would add a second before with former Schalke player Leroy Sane would bring the score up to 3-0 by half time.

With the game already tucked under their belts, City ran riot. Further goals from Raheem Sterling, Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden and Gabriel Jesus left Schalke a sight for sore eyes.

Guardiola describe his side before the match as the “teenagers” of the tournament. That maybe so in terms of history, but when you take ability and prowess into account, it can’t be denied that Manchester City are standout favourites.
